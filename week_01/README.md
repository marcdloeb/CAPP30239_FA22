# Marc David Loeb

Born and raised in New York City, I first came to Chicago five years ago as a UChicago undergrad. I completed my BA in Geography, History and Public Policy, with a broad focus on the post-WWII suburbanization of the United States. Before commencing the MSCAPP program last school year, I had some background in GIS, but lacked a broad foundation in computer or data science.
