This folder contains the code and data for the Line Chart Exercise.

This homework continued our introduction to the fundemental data visualizations in Java Script and D3, familiarizing us with the line and area chart types

Contents
area.html: The HTML document that frames the area chart svg, does some CSS styling, and links to the D3 library

homework.js: The data driven document that creates the area chart svg based on library_visits_jan22.csv

library_visits_jan22.csv: The data for the area chart. The data records the month-by-month interest rate in Canada for the entirety of 2020. The dates are recorded in the year-month format, which necessitates specific interpretation by D3. The data is sourced from the class [github](https://github.com/tiffanyfrance/CAPP30239_FA22/blob/main/week_04/long-term-interest-canada.csv)
