# CAPP30239_FA22

Welcome to my Git Hub page for CAPP 30239 Data Visualization Fall 2022. This course, taught by Tiffany France, was taken as part of my masters degree in computational analysis and public policy at the University of Chicago.

This repo is organized on a week-by-week basis. The seven weeks of class work prior to the last updating of this README are organized as follows

- [week_01](https://github.com/marcdloeb/CAPP30239_FA22/tree/main/week_01)
This week contains no subdirectories. However, the week_01 README contains a data selfie
