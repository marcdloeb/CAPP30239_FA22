This folder contains the data that is going to be used as part of my final project. Two data gathering tasks remain, one essential the other aspirational.

The essential (but tedious) task is to convert historic census tract shapefiles into geojsons.
The aspirational task is updating my street address data gathering code, to include the web address that links to the historic articles. This will be used as part of a hover function in the final project.

There are 56,608 street addresses in the data.
