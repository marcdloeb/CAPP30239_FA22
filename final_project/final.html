    <h1>Final Charts Draft</h1>
    <h3>Marc David Loeb</h3>
    <h2>11-20-2022</h2>

    <p>
      During the second half of the 20th Century, the University of Chicago embarked on a campaign to radically reshape Hyde Park. During the years after the Second World War, the traditional geographical boundaries separating White and Black communities on Chicago's South East Side crumbled. The university perceived the “flood” of African Americans into the neighborhoods it long considered its own--Hyde Park, Kenwood, and Woodlawn--as an existential threat to the institution. Theories of urban change developed at the University itself decades earlier predicted that even a small Black community would initiate a process inevitably culminating in the reduction of a district to a run down slum. The rush of students and faculty out of the neighborhoods adjoining the university's campus created a self-fulfilling prophecy. It was believed that without radical action the university would soon be forced to follow them to the suburbs. 
    </p>

    <p>
      To head off this fate, the university would demolish much of western and northern Hyde Park, destroying over 4,000 units of housing and displacing more than 10,000 people. Proposed in 1954 and approved by the city in 1958, it was the first urban renewal conducted by an institution of higher education. The following year Congress formally extended the right of eminent domain to colleges and universities, following a lobbying effort by a coalition of institutions that sought to emulate the University of Chicago's model.
    </p>

    <p>
      There is no shortage of documentation and commentary on the University of Chicago's renewal of Hyde Park, and its national significance. However, this work has remained almost purely qualitative. No prior attempt has been made to quantify the precise spatial extent of the “university community”--a nebulously defined idea that nevertheless held great power among university decision makers--and how it grew and shrank in the face of demographic and policy evolutions. The street addresses contained in 20th century community print publications provide a means to do so. Those printed, for example, in the Daily Maroon--the student paper--largely appear as part of business and apartment advertisements, a running record of where students and faculty were willing to live or shop.

    <h1>Chart #1: Linked Scatter</h1>
    <p>
      This is my least complete chart. It is intended to be a connected scatter plot, which will allow us to see the evolution of the Black population version the share of all street addresses in 8 different neighborhoods near the University of Chicago.
      The scatter is working (street address proportion on the y axis, black percentage on the x) but I can't get the lines to render for some reason.

    <h1>Chart #2: Normalized Area</h1>
    <p>
      So, whenever I include the code for this chart, my maps break for unknown reasons. I am currently in the process of debugging this. Please check again by end of day Monday.

    <h1>Chart #3: Map Series</h1>
    <h1>Street Address Points and Percent Black, 1926-1935</h1>
    <p>
      This series of eight maps reflects the evolving relationship between the Black population on Chicago's Southeast Side, and the street addresses that appear in University of Chicago campus and community publications

      While this series of maps is the most complete of my charts, there are several changes I hope to make. First, there area many overlapping points. I hope to instead scale the size of points based on the number of street addresses in that location during the decade.
      Additionally, I want to zoom the maps in a bit, and cut the land area covered in the maps by about 50%. Finally, if time permits, I'm going to pull in a modern street grid, and polygons for the lake and parks. This will give people are better sense of where this actually is
