		<h1>Tracking the Extent of the University Community</h1>
		<h3>Marc David Loeb, CAPP 30239 Final Project, 12-5-2022</h3>

    <p>
      The evolution of the street addresses that appear in University of Chicago community publications allows us to quantify the spatial extent of the “university community,” and how it changed in response to shifts in the Black population of the South Side, and the university's campaign of urban renewal. 
      The story told here is based on research completed as part of my
      <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZVRh9YOxSr7tDiPdaIStOugyxK5Wpu8-/edit?usp=share_link&ouid=113194659060512963592&rtpof=true&sd=true">BA thesis project</a>

			During the second half of the 20th Century, the University of Chicago embarked on a campaign to radically reshape Hyde Park. During the years after the Second World War, the traditional geographical boundaries separating White and Black communities on Chicago's South East Side crumbled. The university perceived the “flood” of African Americans into the neighborhoods it long considered its own--Hyde Park, Kenwood, and Woodlawn--as an existential threat to the institution. Theories of urban change developed at the University itself decades earlier predicted that even a small Black community would initiate a process inevitably culminating in the reduction of a district to a run down slum. The rush of students and faculty out of the neighborhoods adjoining the university's campus created a self-fulfilling prophecy. It was believed that without radical action the university would soon be forced to follow them to the suburbs. 
		
    </p>
	  
		<p>
			To head off this fate, the university would demolish much of western and northern Hyde Park, destroying over 4,000 units of housing and displacing more than 10,000 people. Proposed in 1954 and approved by the city in 1958, it was the first urban renewal conducted by an institution of higher education. The following year Congress formally extended the right of eminent domain to colleges and universities, following a lobbying effort by a coalition of institutions that sought to emulate the University of Chicago's model.
		  
    </p>
	  
    <hr>

    <p>
      The story of urban renewal in Hyde Park begins at the turn of the Century. The University of Chicago was a young institution, founded in 1890. The City of Chicago was booming, having become the second largest in America in 1870. Despite the end of Slavery in 1865, the vast majority of America's Black Population remained confined to the South, trapped by poverty and sharecropping. 
		</p>

    <p>
      This changed in the first two decades of the 20th century. 
      The racial terrorism of the Second KKK, and the Boll-Weevile cotton blight kicked off the “Great Migration” to the industrial center of the North. 
      Many Black families coming to Chicago in search of economic opportunity came by way of the Illinois Central Railroad, with its terminus on the South Side. 
      By the time of the 1920 Census, the first to include tract-level data on race for Chicago, a clear “Black Belt” on the South Side had begun to form. Anti-Black race riots in 1919 ensured that the Black Community remained confined to a narrow strip between State Street in the west, and Cottage Grove in the east, which separated it from the largely white neighborhoods adjoining the University of Chicago. 
		</p>

    <p>
      This equilibrium collapsed after WWII, as federal housing policy subsidized suburban development for White families, and excluded Blacks through Redlining. The Black community expanded east, into neighborhoods the University of Chicago considered its own--Hyde Park, Woodlawn, Kenwood--and set off the racial panic that would culminate in the University's campaign of urban renewal.
		</p>

    <p>
      There is no shortage of documentation and commentary on the University of Chicago's renewal of Hyde Park, and its national significance. However, this work has remained almost purely qualitative. No prior attempt has been made to quantify the precise spatial extent of the “university community”--a nebulously defined idea that nevertheless held great power among university decision makers--and how it grew and shrank in the face of demographic and policy evolutions.
      The street addresses contained in 20th century UChicago community 
      <a href="https://campub.lib.uchicago.edu/">print publications</a>
      provide a means to do so. Those printed, for example, in the Daily Maroon--the student paper--largely appear as part of business and apartment advertisements. 
      These serve as a running record of where students and faculty were willing to live or shop in the period from 1902 to 1986, which can be compared to the growth of the Black Population.
      These street addresses, and census data on race, appear in the maps below of Southeast Chicago.

				Despite the scope of the forces enlisted in support of the urban renewal campaign (which included the City government, a gaggle of nonprofits, and a number of student and faculty organizations) the University of Chicago never expected to be able to maintain an all-white bubble. Instead it aimed to, in its own words, “stabilize” the population of Hyde Park and neighboring South Kenwood. The vast majority of the property the University seized and demolished housed White People. It was rebuilt into single family homes and apartment towers oriented towards faculty members and students. The intent was to maintain a stable Black minority, and fix as many members of the University Community in place, to staunch the bleeding to the suburbs. 
			</p>
			<p>
				The data speak to this. At the beginning of the 20th century, Hyde Park (the neighborhood immediately to the north of the UChicago campus) contained only about 60% of all community related street addresses. Collectively North and South Woodlawn, immediately to the south of the campus, contain 20% to 30% in the decades before WWII. South Kenwood and Hyde Park are the only neighborhoods that gain street address share as their Black population grows from 1956 to 1986. 
      </p>

			<p>
				The other neighborhoods of Southeast Chicago have different stories to tell. The incredibly rapid departure of the University Community from certain neighborhoods as their Black population grew matches claims in the archives and historical record. 
        In the earliest decades of the 20th century, students and faculty members were eager to live or shop in the areas that, by the 1920s, would become the Black Belt. In 1902, the number of University related street addresses in the neighborhood were 400% higher than the average for the period between 1902 and 1986. The neighborhood would experience dramatic declines in 1905 and 1935.
      </p>
			<p>
				In the period from 1925 to 1940, South Woodlawn contained a number of addresses more than 200% above average. The growth of the Black population after WWII, and a 1949 University memo warning students that the area was becoming a slum, dropped this figure to 80% below average by 1960, a tenfold decline in absolute terms. North Woodlawn sees smaller declines, stabilizing after a student campaign in the 1960s results in the expansion of the University of Chicago Police Department to the area.
      </p>
			<p>
				South Shore bore witness to a brief spike in in the 1960s and 70s, following the extension of a campus shuttle service (which barred non-university affiliated persons from riding) to the area. The number of addresses collapsed in the 1980s, as the Black population grew.

    <h1>Process</h1>
    <p>
      This project is an extension of research that I completed as part of my undergraduate BA thesis project, on the history of the University of Chicago's campus shuttle system (which is set to be published in the 2021 edition of Chicago studies). As someone studying urban history and policy, I increasingly wondered why the University felt the need to operate its own private transportation system. 
      I had an inkling in the back of my mind that it may have something to do with the University's history of urban renewal. A meeting with the head of the Department of Safety and Security (which operates the shuttles) revealed that no one actually knew when, let alone why, the shuttles were introduced. The bulk of my BA was dedicated to digging into primary sources and old administrative records held in Special Collections in the Regenstein library. I discovered that the shuttles were first introduced in 1957, the year before the Hyde Park urban renewal plan was approved in 1958, and was promoted by several of the same key figures. 
    </p>
    <p>
      While I found a plethora of insightful sources, I was increasingly frustrated by the lack of quantitative grounding in the archive. Students, faculty and administrators across the archive made claims about the geographic extent of the nebulously defined “University Community,” and its relationship to the growth of the Black Population and various urban renewal policies (including the extension of the shuttle system to places like Kenwood and South Shore). But none of them had data to prove it. 
      That's what inspired me to scrape out all the street addresses that appear in the University's campus publications in the 20th century.

    </p>

    <p>
      As a highly inexperienced programmer at the time, it took me six months to write and execute my scraping script, even with a lot of support from my advisors. Ultimately, I used a for-loop and a curl function in Python to plug each of the 
      
      <a href="https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Chicago-Street-Names/i6bp-fvbx/data">6 million street addresses</a>
      on the South Side into the keyword search tool of the Campus Publications digital archive (and was blessed not to have my IP address blocked by the Library's webmaster). This gave me the dates that each street address appeared in the archive. I geocoded the addresses with ggmap in R. Because the process was so time consuming, I had no time to properly aggregate, analyze or visualize my data, beyond very rough graphs in Excel. This data visualization project has given me the chance to do so.
    </p>

    <p>
      Preparing my data for this project took somewhere in the realm of 40 hours of work in R and QGIS. 
      Because I wanted to use tract level data for a very specific area, I couldn't rely on the existing topojsons structured to work with D3. I had to build my own. 
      I downloaded historical census tract level data (and shapefiles) on race for every decade from 1920 to 1980 from 
      <a href="https://www.nhgis.org/">IPUMS</a>.
      I loaded these into R and converted the shapefiles into GeoJSONs. I converted my CSV of street address lat/lon values into spatial points using SF in R. 
      I then did a spatial join to get the number of points in each census tract. I created some neighborhood polygons in QGIS, and did a spatial join (in R) to assign each tract a neighborhood label. This allowed me to calculate summary statistics by neighborhood. All in all I have about 800 lines of R code. The GeoJSONs that R spits out do not have id values (even if you assign one in code). I had to load all of my complete GeoJSONs into QGIS, and redownload them with an id value with a trick from 
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34314066/adding-a-unique-feature-id-to-geojson-in-qgis-or-python">stackoverflow</a>
      I then loaded my GeoJSONs of street address points and race tracts for each decade into mapshaper, which spat out nested TopoJSONs. The summary statistic CVSs for the charts could be loaded into D3 directly. There are some flaws in my data. First among these is that I did my searches with modern street addresses, leading to missing data on streets that changed their name during the 20th century.
    </p>

    <p>
      My series of maps contains three layers: census tract polygons, park polygons taken from OpenStreetMap, and the street address points.
      While I was settled on the map series from the beginning, it took me some time to come up with my two charts. 
      Prof. France suggested the connected scatter plot, showing how the relationship between race and the number of street addresses evolved in each neighborhood. 
      I was inspired to do the multiline by the failure of a stacked area chart (Hyde Park is simply too disproportionate to the other neighborhoods to get a legible visualization). 
      By normalizing the number of street addresses in each neighborhood in a year relative to their average over the whole dataset, we can get a better sense of the granular changes occurring in each place. 
      While Census data on race exists only for decades, my street address can be shown year-by-year.
