        <p>
            After a period of exploration, I chose to decompose the 1500 people shot be police in 2015 by state
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tiffanyfrance/CAPP30239_FA22/blob/main/week_06/a3cleanedonly2015.json" target="_blank">Data Link</a>
        <p>

            There are two reasons why I chose killings by state as my area of interest. 
            First, I think that state police shooting rates capture regional variations in culture, values and policy that extend beyond simple demographics or crime rates
            Though not adjusted by population size, some of these variations are aparent despite the absence of per capita figures
            Florida has more than thrice the number of police killins as New York, despite a similar population.
            California and Texas have totals that appear proportional to each other, but disproportionate relative to the country as a whole
            Arkansas and Connecticut, one an extremely poor state, the other extremely wealthy, both home to roughly three million people, have disproportionately few police killings.
        <p>
            The first chart that I chose to make was a simple bar chart, with an animated transition when the page opens.
            The chart type is not perfectly suited to this data. 50 bars really pushes what's comprehensible. 
            I had to dial down the text size so that the labels were fully visible. 
            Nevertheless, the bar served as a useful starting point for initial exploration.
            I included a simple transition. When the document is first accessed, the bars rise to their full height and the color shifts from light yellow to gold

        <p>
            My second chart is a donut chart, depicting the number of killings in the top 10 states.
            I used this chart as an opportunity to experiment with color schemes, and chose the 10 entry Tableu scheme.
            I think that this chart is more effective at demonstrating the proportional relationship between the top states than the bar chart.
            Texas and California take up more than half of the total. However, given the fact that the data is not scaled by population size,
            the actual signifigance of this, and whether the two states have outsized police killing rates (as opposed to totals) is difficult to discern
            from the chart alone.
        </p>

        <p>
            My third chart is a stacked bar chart, which displays the number of killings by race in the top 11 states, with the remaining 39 states grouped together into an "other" bar.
            Perhaps surprisingly, in most states there are a greater number of police killings of white people than Black people. However, these totals do not account for 
            the demographics of each state. Louisiana, Virginia and Georgia are all marjority White states, but have are more police killings of Blacks.
