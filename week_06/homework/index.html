        <p>
            After a period of exploration, I chose to decompose the 1500 people shot be police in 2015 by state
        <p>
            <a href="https://github.com/tiffanyfrance/CAPP30239_FA22/blob/main/week_06/a3cleanedonly2015.json" target="_blank">Data Link</a>
        <p>

            There are two reasons why I chose killings by state as my area of interest. 
            First, I think that state police shooting rates capture regional variations in culture, values and policy that extend beyond simple demographics or crime rates
            Though not adjusted by population size, some of these variations are aparent despite the absence of per capita figures
            Florida has more than thrice the number of police killins as New York, despite a similar population.
            California and Texas have totals that appear proportional to each other, but disproportionate relative to the country as a whole
            Arkansas and Connecticut, one an extremely poor state, the other extremely wealthy, both home to roughly three million people, have disproportionately few police killings.
        <p>
            The first chart that I chose to make was a simple bar chart, with an animated transition when the page opens.
            The chart type is not perfectly suited to this data. 50 bars really pushes what's comprehensible. 
            I had to dial down the text size so that the labels were fully visible. 
            Nevertheless, the bar served as a useful starting point for initial exploration.
            I included a simple transition. When the document is first accessed, the bars rise to their full height and the color shifts from light yellow to gold

            My second chart is a donut chart. I hoped that it would serve to better depict the proportion of all killings by police in each state.

            My third chart is a choropleth map, taken from Observable, which colors each state according to their number of killings
